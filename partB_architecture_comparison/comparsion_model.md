| Model | Best For | Strength | Limitation | Overall Result |
|-------|----------|----------|------------|----------------|
| ANN   | Tabular Data | Simple, fast, and easy to train | Cannot learn spatial patterns | Moderate |
| CNN   | Image Data   | Excellent at learning spatial features | Needs more data and computation | Best |
| RNN   | Sequential Data | Good at handling time/sequence information | Performs poorly on images | Weak |
