This assessment helped me realize that achieving good model performance depends more on the quality of data, the right architecture selection, and stable training techniques rather than simply increasing model complexity.  


It showed me that even a powerful model can fail if the dataset is not properly prepared or if the model is not suitable for the given task. I also learned that factors like learning rate, batch normalization, and dropout play a major role in improving convergence and preventing overfitting.  


Overall, this assessment strengthened my understanding that successful machine learning requires a balanced approach involving data preprocessing, correct model design, and proper optimization strategies.
